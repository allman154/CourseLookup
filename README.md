# Course Day Separator – Java Code Sample

**Description:**  
Separates university courses into meeting days (Mon/Wed/Fri vs Tue/Thu) using nested loops, switch-case logic, and HashMaps.

**Structure:**

- Model classes (`Course`, `Courses`, `Student`, `Faculty`, `Major`)
- JDBC/OJDBC-style stubs (non-functional, for demonstration only)
- Mock data populate methods (functional for demo)
- `CourseDaySeparator` controller that executes the process to sort courses by meeting days and prints the data
- Small `App.java` that instantiates the controller
